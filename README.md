## Usage

This website may be used to help your own understanding of vocab and concepts used in the Prework course section of coding bootcamp. For ease and organization, there are blocks of sections for each subject, currently being HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, and JavaScript. I've also bolded each vocab word or concept point for further organization for each bullet point. This site is primarily just for notes and basic knowlege of Prework contents.
