        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> - Gives content structure. It's made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Application</strong> - App accessed via a web browser that allows users to perform tasks on the internet by entering URL.</li>
          <li><strong>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</strong> - Fundamental web development concept, of which users enter it into a browser, or by clicking a link, to access a web app. It is a unique address given to a specific resource on the web.</li>
          <li><strong>Element</strong> - A type of content on a webpage. Can be seen on webpage & also can be used to divide the content on the page and describe the content to the browser and other developers. Refers to the entire "element" from opening tag to closing tag. (Most common types of elements are: Text, Image, Header, & List & Most common divider type elements are: Meta-related, content division, & Semantic)</li>
          <li><strong>HTML Attribute</strong> - Defines additional info about an element & is always defined in the beginning of an element, never closing the element.</li>
          <li><strong>Metadata</strong> - Data about our webpage that the browser uses to efficiently serve our web users. Typically is not seen by users, but contains important info about accessibility, search engines, & performance.</li>

          <li><strong>Tag</strong> - Refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li><strong>Opening Tag</strong> & <strong>Closing Tag</strong> - Tags with content in between opening & closing that are used to make the browser understand how to treat the content. Closing tags always begin with a forward slash.</li>
          <li><strong>Headings</strong> - Larger or more prominent titles & subtitles to organize a page. Elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, & h6 represent the level of heading, from largest to smallest (remember to always use in order, and only use h1 once in a webpage).</li>
          <li><strong>Anchor (a)</strong> - Creates a link to the same webpage, or other webpages.</li>
          <li><strong>Head</strong> Element - Contains information, or metadata, about the webpage which helps the browser to render the page correctly. These elements are not visible on the webpage, <em>except</em> for the title element. Is also the "container" for metadata.</li>
          <li><strong>Body</strong> Element - Represents the visible content shown to the user & all the elements that we want the user to see and interact with.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> - A programming language used by developers to define how the webpage content is presented to users & give the content style. Defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. Used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li><strong>Inline CSS</strong> - Used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. Applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only - Useful for quick and permanent changes, but must be edited individually whenever making a design change.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal CSS Style Sheet</strong> - Embeds an entire style sheet directly in the HTML file using a <strong>style</strong> element in the <strong>head</strong> element. Contains CSS roles for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file and the rules only apply to that page and you can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code. (Single change to CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.)</li>
          <li><strong>External CSS Style Sheet</strong> - Most common way to style a webpage. Allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. When used, you link the file using a <strong>link</strong> element placed in the HTML's <strong>head</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> - Refers to separating code into different files based on use. Based on the idea that each selection of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Selector</strong> - Defines the elements or attributes to which the rules (declarations) will apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Declarations</strong> - Contains 2 important components: The CSS property we want to apply, & The value of the property.</li>
          <li><strong>Margin</strong> Property - Indicates how much space around the <em>outside</em> of an element. Is not visible on the page, just adds a buffer. (When set to 0, that indicates <em>no</em> extra space around the element.)</li>
          <li><strong>Padding</strong> Property - Adds space around the content <em>inside</em> an element. (When padding increased, makes the entire element bigger.)</li>
          <li><strong>CSS Box Model</strong> - Every HTML element is essentially a box & each box consists of margins outside of the element, and the element's borders, padding, & content.</li>
          <li><strong>Wild Card Symbol (*)</strong> - Selector used when we want to apply a rule to all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li><strong>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) Code</strong> - Coding principle that encourages developers to reuse, or share pieces of code, in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. Greatly reduces the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li><strong>Img</strong> Selector - Assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li><strong>Link</strong> Element - Specifies relationship between current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li><strong>Rel</strong> Attribute - Specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li><strong>Class Attribute</strong> - Allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li><strong>Box Shadow</strong> - Described by X & Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, & color.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> - High-level, dynamic, object-oriented programming language that allows users to interact with websites, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms. Tool that takes a static HTML/CSS.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Programming Language (APL)</strong> - Set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (application) enabling interaction with it through software, as opposed to a human user interface. Generally a set of code features (methods, properties, events, and URLs) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user’s web browser, other software/hardware on the users computer, or 3rd party websites and services.</li>
          <li><strong>Variable</strong> - A named container that allows us to store data in our code. Is a named reference to values, that way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name. Necessary, since if values couldn’t change the you couldn’t do anything dynamic.</li>
          <li><strong>String</strong> - Sequence of text by signifying values enclosed in either single or double quotation marks.</li>
          <li><strong>Boolean</strong> - True/False values that don’t need quotation marks.</li>
          <li><strong>BigInt Type</strong> - A numeric primitive in JS that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. Can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers. Created by appending ‘n’ to the end of an integer, or, represent big integers more accurately.</li>
          <li><strong>Null</strong> - Special value in JS that refers to the absence of a value.</li>
          <li><strong>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</strong> - A light-weight data-interchange format that builds universal data structures than can be transferred between different environments and even across languages.</li>
          <li><strong>Primitive Coercion Process</strong> - Used where a primitive value is expected, but there’s no strong preference for what the actual type should be. Usually when a string, number, or BigInt are equally acceptable.</li>
          <li><strong>Array</strong> - Structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. Regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the ‘length’ property. Group of related data stored in a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li><strong>Assignment Operator (=)</strong> - Assigns a value or specific data to store inside a variable. </li>
          <li><strong>Strict Operator/Equality (===)</strong> - Performs a test to check if 2 values are equal & of the same data type. Returns a Boolean result, being ‘true’ if equal & ‘false’ if not.</li>
          <li><strong>Symbol</strong> - Unique and immutable primitive value & may be used as the key of an Object property. Sometimes called “atoms.” Purpose is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Property</strong> - Associates a key with a value.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessor Property</strong> - Associates a key with 1 or 2 accessor functions (get & set) to retrieve or store a value.</li>
          <li><strong>Method</strong> - Set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
          <li><strong>Event Handlers</strong> - Code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
          <li><strong>Control Flow</strong> - Order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS, code runs from the first statement on the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom. Can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li><strong>Conditional Statements</strong> - Code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. Most common form used is if…then statements.</li>
          <li><strong>if</strong> Statements - Code will only execute <em>if</em> the statement meets a condition (true).</li>
          <li><strong>Falsy</strong> - Boolean data type with values of false, <em>or</em>, Value of: 0, -0, 0n, “ ”, Null, NaN, or undefined.</li>
          <li><strong>Truthy</strong> - Boolean data type with value of true, <em>and</em>, <em>all</em> other values.</li>
          <li><strong>Index</strong> - Location of individual data item in the array identified with a unique number (location) that follow predicable patterns (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …).</li>
          <li><strong>for</strong> Loop - Uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li><strong>Commenting Out</strong> Code - String of text inside /* and */ that makes code within inactive without deleting it, but making the browser ignore the code.</li>
          <li><strong>Function</strong> - A set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task. Way of packaging functionally that you wish to reuse. Possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in code, likely () following. Often takes arguments.</li>
          <li><strong>Arguments</strong> - Bits of data functions need to do their job. Value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.</li>
          <li><strong>Return Statement</strong> - Tells browser to return the result variable out of the function so it is available to use.</li>
